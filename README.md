# Liam Williams

At my core, I’m a developer who just tries anything.

## Work

I design and build systems where form and function are inseparable.

My work sits across:

- Frontend engineering  
- Backend systems  
- UI / UX design  
- Performance & optimization  
- Tooling and developer experience  

I care about how things look, how they feel, and how they scale.

---

## Approach

- Build the simplest thing that can survive reality  
- Reduce friction until the system disappears  
- Prefer clarity over cleverness  
- Iterate in public, refine in private  

I don’t separate design from engineering.
They are the same problem viewed from different angles.

## Projects

This space is a growing archive.

Some projects are polished.
Some are experiments.
All of them are intentional.

## Notes

This profile is not a résumé.
It’s a record of exploration, decisions, and craft.
